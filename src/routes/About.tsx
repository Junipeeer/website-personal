                  This portfolio website is my biggest React and TS project so
                  far. During this project I have learned a lot about modern
                  standards and best practices for React, including component
                  reusability, type safety, hooks, and context. While I am still
                  learning the deeper details of React, my existing experience
                  with Vue.js, as well as standard HTML, CSS, and JS, means that
                  I am quite comfortable with the underlying concepts already.

                  around standard CSS as well, as I have been interested in web
                  development since 2018. While I am not an expert designer, I
                  am capable of designing and implementing responsive layouts as
